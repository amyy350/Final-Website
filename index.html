        <h1>Pop Music</h1>
        <p>Pop music is a style of music that is designed for accessibility and mass appeal, often incorporating aspects of other genres into a broad genre that can be hard to formally define. Key characteristics of pop music are its use of catchy hooks, repeated choruses, bridges, and rhythms and tempos that encourage dancing.</p>

        <p>Since pop music is defined by what is popular at the time, it is an ever changing genre that is highly dependent on the time period and place. The evolution of pop music included heavy influence from jazz, rock and roll, and hip hop, all of which shaped what we think of as pop music today.</p>

        <p>While pop music is not a rigidly defined genre, it is the combination of other genres that work to create a genre that is able to dominate charts and air space due to its broad appeal.</p>

    <h1>Rock</h1>
    <p>The origins of rock music can be traced back to the US in the late 1940s and the early 1950s with its roots in a multitude of styles including the blues, country music, and jazz music. Characterized by its use of the electric guitar, electric bass, and percussion (produced from a drum kit), rock music became the most popular genre of music in the US from the 70s to the 2010s. There are also many subgenres of rock that have taken off, combining other genres with rock to create a new, unique sound. 
    </p>
    <p>	Rock music has dealt with a wide range of themes, many of which are not present in pop music, including the folk tradition of the protest song. Because of its emphasis on authenticity and its ties to the 1960s counterculture, rock music has also become associated with political activism and the push back against conformity.

         <h1>Hip-Hop</h1>
            <p>Hip-hop and its associated subculture originated in the early 1970s, emerging from the ethnic neighborhoods in New York City, particularly the Bronx where it is highly connected to the Black and Latino culture of the area. Characterized by rapping, beatboxing, DJ-ing, and cultural exchange, hip-hop music expanded beyond NYC to become a global phenomenon. In the US, hip-hop has made its way to several regional scenes in the West and East coast along with the South. This expansion to different parts of the country led to the emergence of different styles of hip-hop and a nationwide interest in the culture behind the music.
            </p>
            <p>Hip-hop and rap music has become a global phenomenon nowadays, but its origins in Black and Latino American culture has always been a defining feature in the continuation of the genre. Hip-hop music and culture reflects the realities of the communities who produce it, with many using it as a tool to shed light on social and political issues and for cultural empowerment. Hip-hop as a genre is intrinsically tied to the communities it speaks about and cannot be separated from the people it draws its inspiration from.

           <p>Classic R&B is jazz-based and often consists of guitars, pianos, drums, and saxophones with strong vocal performances. Contemporary R&B incorporates more electronic instruments and takes more inspiration from hip-hop and other music genres. 
           </p>
           <p>While R&B has contributed to many other influential music genres such as rock and soul music, it still remains deeply tied to its African American roots, even as the genre has expanded. Over time, R&B has evolved and incorporated more electronic elements along with creating several sub-branches of the genre. Nowadays, R&B as a genre has become more broad and has generated a more general appeal.

         <h1>Folk</h1>
            <p>The definition of traditional folk music is heavily debated, but it can be described as traditional music for the community it serves, characterized by oral transmission, often cultural in nature, commemorating events, and performed over several generations. 
            </p>
            <p>	Contemporary folk music emerged in the mid-20th century and evolved from traditional folk music. Like traditional folk music, contemporary folk music does not really have a singular definition and instead is characterized by several similarities between the music within the genre. The similarities include: embracing acoustic or tradition based music, mainly Western-European in origin, and English based. During the cultural and political changes of the mid 60s-early 70s, contemporary folk music became associated with protest songs as it increasingly included political messages and sang about the pressing issues of the times. It has given way to many subgenres and has recently had a resurgence in mainstream culture with the rise of popularity of many folk music artists.
